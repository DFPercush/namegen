# namegen

#### A goofy random name generator

This program generates somewhat-pronouncable names by analyzing a dictionary of words (English dictionary included) and using a probability distribution to select sequences of characters that are likely to make sense in that language. It does not use fancy AI or have any notion of dialect or style, other than the chance of one character given the previous (two) characters. The dictionary file `words.txt` can be replaced with other languages as necessary.
